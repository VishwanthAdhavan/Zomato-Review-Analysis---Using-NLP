# Zomato-Review-Analysis---Using-NLP

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains customer reviews of restaurants listed on **Zomato**, along with corresponding ratings and metadata.  
The goal of this project is to perform **sentiment analysis** on these reviews to classify them as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**, and to gain insights into customer satisfaction trends.
